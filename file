Hey everyone, for Project 1 there are a few people that are wanting to go farther and put a fancy user interface into their project.  
Just to be clear, having a really great user interface attached to a really basic API is not going to get you any bonus points.  
We would rather see a complex API, perhaps have your API calling another 3rd party API or doing some other more "spicy" stuff.  
If you are farther ahead in the class then focus on the purpose of the project, in this case you are building an API, and build a really amazing API with lots of functionality rather than building a front-end.  Thanks!
